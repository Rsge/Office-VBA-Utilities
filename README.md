# Office VBA Utilities
A collection of different VBA scripts for different applications in MS Office.<br>
It's broken up by Office application, then Office file intention.

### Excel
* `Attendence time table` has scripts for automated clearing of specific part with prior confirmation and un-/protecting the document via bindable macro.<br>
* `Production planning has` lots of scripts for different calculations related to and needed for planning production, e.g. finding holidays and calculating production capacities.

### Outlook
* `BulkEditContacts.bas` allows for bulk-editing of contacts.<br>
* `JunkMailBlackWhiteList.bas` force-whitelists mails under specified conditions and blacklists all addresses in a provided (linebreak-separated) text file (because "normal" rules are limited in max number of mails).<br>
* `MoveFromFolderToFolder.bas` moves all mails from one folder to another reliably one-by-one.<br>
* `MoveToCorrectSentFolder.cls` moves each sent email to the correct mailbox' Sent-elements-folder (Because per default they go into the main account's).<br>

### Word
* For `Continual numbering  ` all three files need to be used to achieve a counter counting the amount of pages printed on the page with the ability to set on print.<br>
